## [Types of Good](id:anchor1.2)

- Sense of ambiguity in what we are searching for
- the art of *politikos*, statesmanship
	- art concerned with the ultimate end because it is grander and more difficult to use than the art of achieving the chief good for oneself
	- It is the most *ruling* science, because all other sciences fall under its domain
		- Rather, it can be said that the statesman directs all the other arts-men
		

## [Ways of Living](id:anchor1.3)

- Aristotle believes there are 3 kinds of life people lead
	1. Hedonistic lifestyle
	2. Life of political activity
	3. Life of scholarship
- Dismisses the 1st lifestyle immediately
- The second lifestyle Aristotle believes people undertake for 2 reasons:
	1. Honor/Virtue
	2. 
- "Orgasmic oyster" and the Nozick experience machine

## [Criteria for Good](id:anchor1.4)

- 2 criteria for the good:
	1. *teleos* - completeness / ultimate-ness
	2. Self-sufficiency
	
- Complete goods are goods that are ends-in-themselves
- *Self-sufficient* goods are goods of which nothing more can be added to it to make it better

## [Function Argument](id:anchor1.5)

- What is the function of the human life?
- If we treat the human life as a function, we can describe its good as a product of that function
- The good of a function is what makes it perform that function well
- The Body Parts argument
	- If each of our parts has itself a function, do we not holistically have a function as well? [Reproduction, survival, living a kind of life]
	- What makes it different from analogous organisms

	- Nozick, *Moral Luck*
- Virtue in a fine death
	- E.g. death in battle
	- Death in sickness is not a fine death

		- *There are things worse than death*

### Internal and External Reasons for Bravery

- see Bernard Williams

	- One only *observes* things of this nature
	- E.g. species breed *true to type*
		- Hippopotamuses beget hippopotamuses if they breed with other hippopotamuses
- 2 is concerned with things whose principles can have been otherwise
	- Involved in calculation/deliberation
	
- **Principle** as Aristotle defines it is a *first*, *principal* cause
	- Starting points for *proofs*
	- e.g. *postulates*
- *Nous* - knowledge of principles, first causes
- *Episteme* - resultant knowledge arising from principles, once you have *nous*; **provable** knowledge
- *Techne* - *how-to* knowledge
- A object's principle *sufficiently* describes itself and can explain other secondary features of that object
